## The Process

This project was built as a personal self-improvement tool inspired by the Solo Leveling series. The development focused on:

- Setting up a Next.js 14 application with modern frontend tooling
- Implementing a gamified stat and leveling system
- Creating persistent state management with Zustand and localStorage
- Building an intuitive UI for tracking daily progress
- Designing engaging animations for level-ups and achievements

## What I Learned

- **State Management** - Deepened understanding of Zustand for complex state with persistence
- **Next.js App Router** - Gained experience with the latest Next.js routing patterns
- **Animation Design** - Learned to create engaging micro-interactions with Framer Motion
- **Gamification** - Understanding how to make mundane tasks engaging through game mechanics

## What Could Be Improved

- Add cloud sync for data backup across devices
- Implement social features for accountability partners
- Add customizable quest templates
- Include achievement badges and milestones
- Add data visualization for long-term progress
- Implement mobile app version
- Add reminders and notifications
- Create a public API for integrations
